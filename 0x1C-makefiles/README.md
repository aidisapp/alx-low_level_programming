# C - Makefiles

## Description

This repository contains a series of Makefile projects aimed at understanding and implementing Makefiles in C programming.

## Project Tasks

1. **0-Makefile**: Created a basic Makefile that builds an executable named `school`.
2. **1-Makefile**: Extended the Makefile to include variables `CC` and `SRC` for compiler and source files respectively.
3. **2-Makefile**: Developed a Makefile with additional variables `OBJ` and `NAME` to handle object files and executable name.
4. **3-Makefile**: Created a Makefile with rules for `all`, `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean`, and `re`, along with appropriate variables.
5. **4-Makefile**: Enhanced the Makefile with compiler flags and rules to handle cleaning and recompilation.
6. **5-island_perimeter.py**: Implemented a Python function to calculate the perimeter of an island based on a given grid.
7. **100-Makefile**: Advanced Makefile implementation with stricter rules and optimizations.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Version of gcc: 9.3.0
- Version of make: GNU Make 4.2.1
- All files end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

## Usage

To compile and run each Makefile project, navigate to the respective directory and use the `make` command along with the filename. For example:

```bash
make -f 0-Makefile
